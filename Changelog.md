## CHANGELOG

## [v1.8.1] - 2024-12-30

### Added

- **PG Vector Integration**:
- Replaced Pinecone with Supabase's pgvector for document embeddings storage and similarity search.

### Why Replace Pinecone?

While Pinecone is popular, it presented significant challenges in production:

- **Lack of Type Safety**:

  - No proper TypeScript support
  - Difficult to maintain type consistency
  - Error-prone metadata management

- **Data Management Nightmare**:

  - No SQL support for updating metadata
  - Having to maintain data in two separate systems
  - Complex and limited update operations

- **Support and Cost Issues**:
  - Unresponsive support team
  - Limited help with technical issues
  - Expensive serverless pricing model

### Benefits of Supabase pgvector

The migration to pgvector provides:

- **Unified Data Layer**:

  - Single database for all application data
  - Native PostgreSQL features
  - Built-in Row Level Security (RLS)

- **Better Development**:

  - Familiar SQL interface
  - Strong type checking
  - Improved debugging tools

- **Enhanced Query Optimization**:
  - Implemented an intelligent query preprocessing step for document similarity search.
  - Query variation generation for improved semantic matching
  - Context-aware query reformulation based on document metadata
  - Automatic deduplication of search results
  - Improved relevance through multi-query aggregation

### Technical Implementation

#### Vector Document Storage

```sql
-- Enable the vector extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector WITH SCHEMA extensions;

-- Create the vector_documents table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.vector_documents (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,
  embedding extensions.vector(3072),
  text_content text NOT NULL,
  title text NOT NULL,
  timestamp date NOT NULL,
  ai_title text,
  ai_description text,
  ai_maintopics text[],
  ai_keyentities text[],
  filter_tags text,
  page_number integer NOT NULL,
  total_pages integer NOT NULL,
  chunk_number integer NOT NULL,
  total_chunks integer NOT NULL,
  primary_language text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  CONSTRAINT vector_documents_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT vector_documents_unique_chunk UNIQUE (user_id, title, "timestamp", page_number, chunk_number),
  CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
-- Note: PostgreSQL currently does not support indexing vectors with more than 2,000 dimensions. If you have hundreds of thousands of documents resulting in hundreds of thousands of vectors, you need to use an embedding model that produces 2,000 dimensions or fewer.

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vector_documents_user_id ON public.vector_documents USING btree (user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vector_documents_lookup ON public.vector_documents USING btree (
  user_id,
  title,
  "timestamp",
  page_number,
  chunk_number
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.vector_documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Optimized RLS Policies for vector_documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can only read their own documents"
ON public.vector_documents
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (user_id = (SELECT auth.uid()));
```

#### Similarity Search Function

Implemented an efficient similarity search stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_documents(
  query_embedding vector(3072),
  match_count int,
  filter_user_id uuid,
  filter_files text[],
  similarity_threshold float
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  text_content text,
  title text,
  doc_timestamp date,
  ai_title text,
  ai_description text,
  ai_maintopics text[],
  ai_keyentities text[],
  filter_tags text,
  page_number int,
  total_pages int,
  chunk_number int,
  total_chunks int,
  similarity float
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    vd.id,
    vd.text_content,
    vd.title,
    vd."timestamp" as doc_timestamp,
    vd.ai_title,
    vd.ai_description,
    vd.ai_maintopics,
    vd.ai_keyentities,
    vd.filter_tags,
    vd.page_number,
    vd.total_pages,
    vd.chunk_number,
    vd.total_chunks,
    1 - (vd.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  FROM
    vector_documents vd
  WHERE
    vd.user_id = filter_user_id
    AND vd.filter_tags = ANY(filter_files)
    AND 1 - (vd.embedding <=> query_embedding) > similarity_threshold
  ORDER BY
    vd.embedding <=> query_embedding ASC
  LIMIT LEAST(match_count, 200);
END;
$$;
```

      user_id uuid not null,
      created_at timestamp with time zone not null default current_timestamp,
      updated_at timestamp with time zone not null default current_timestamp,
      chat_title null,
      constraint chat_sessions_pkey primary key (id),
      constraint chat_sessions_user_id_fkey foreign key (user_id) references users (id)
    ) tablespace pg_default;

  create index if not exists idx_chat_sessions_user_id on public.chat_sessions using btree (user_id) tablespace pg_default;

  create index if not exists chat_sessions_created_at_idx on public.chat_sessions using btree (created_at) tablespace pg_default;

  -- Enable RLS for chat_sessions
  alter table public.chat_sessions enable row level security;

  -- Chat sessions RLS policy
  create policy "Users can view own chat sessions"
  on public.chat_sessions
  as permissive
  for all
  to public
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

    -- Chat Messages Table
  create table
    public.chat_messages (
      id uuid not null default extensions.uuid_generate_v4 (),
      chat_session_id uuid not null,
      content text null,
      is_user_message boolean not null,
      sources jsonb null,
      created_at timestamp with time zone not null default current_timestamp,
      constraint chat_messages_pkey primary key (id),
      constraint chat_messages_chat_session_id_fkey foreign key (chat_session_id) references chat_sessions (id) on delete cascade
    ) tablespace pg_default;

  create index if not exists idx_chat_messages_chat_session_id on public.chat_messages using btree (chat_session_id) tablespace pg_default;

  -- Enable RLS for chat_messages
  alter table public.chat_messages enable row level security;

  -- Chat messages RLS policy
  create policy "Users can view messages from their sessions"
  on public.chat_messages
  as permissive
  for all
  to public
  using (
    chat_session_id IN (
      SELECT chat_sessions.id
      FROM chat_sessions
      WHERE chat_sessions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
  ```

## [v1.5.0] - 2024-06-02

### Added

- **End-to-End Types**: Implemented types for `ServerMessage`, `ClientMessage`, `SubmitMessageResult`, and `ChatHistoryUpdateResult` to ensure type safety from client to server actions.
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed various bugs throughout the application.
- **Chat History Improvement**: Enhanced the chat history feature in the server action chatbot to load the 30 newest messages initially, with a "load more" button to retrieve the next 30 messages.
- **Perplexity Provider Integration**: Updated the integration of the Perplexity provider to use the `@ai-sdk/openai` module. This involved changing from the old OpenAI configuration to the new `createOpenAI` function from `@ai-sdk/openai`, ensuring compatibility with the Perplexity API. The updated code allows for seamless streaming of text responses and includes better error handling and rate limiting.

## [v1.4.0] - 2024-05-25

### Added

- **Vercel AI SDK Example**: Added an example demonstrating the usage of the new Vercel AI SDK with the `use server` directive. This example showcases how to create a Server Action to query a language model and update the frontend UI accordingly.
- **Chat History**: Implemented a chat history feature that allows users to view and interact with their previous conversations. The chat history is seamlessly integrated into the user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Streaming UI Feature**: Introduced a real-time streaming UI feature that enables users to see the AI-generated responses as they are being generated. This feature provides a more engaging and interactive experience, mimicking a natural conversation flow.
